# Java second assignment

You will be implementing a travel in Europe project. Make the code as good quality as you can. Follow the Java conventions 
when it comes to styling/formatting your code (correct indentation, standard capitalization in names, etc.) and other best practices 
(proper encapsulation, closing all opened files, etc.).

# Task 1: DateAndTime, Destination, DestinationUtils, Flight (3 Points)

Create the `assignment2.travel.DateAndTime` class with the following fields that are not accessible from other classes:
`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `minute` all of type `int`. All of these fields have getters.

- The class has two constructors:
    1. A constructor that takes all the fields, and sets their values accordingly.
    2. A constructor that takes no parameters. It calls the previously defined constructor with the following values:
          - `year`: 2021
          - `month`: 12
          - `day`: 22
          - `hour`: 04
          - `minute`: 30
    - Hint: Calling an other constructor can be done with the `this(parameters)`.
- Create an implementation the standard method that creates the textual representation of a `DateAndTime` object returns a text like this: `2021.12.22 at 4:30`
- Create `getTime()` which returns a text like this: `4:30`

Create an enum `assignment2.travel.Destination` which includes five destinations: `BERLIN`, `ROME`, `AMSTERDAM`, `PARIS`, and `HELSINKI`.

Create a class `assignment2.travel.DestinationUtils`.

The methods in `DestinationUtils` are the following:

- Its static method `getDestination()` takes a `String` argument which represents a travel duration. 
The string is formatted as `hour:minute` (you **don't** have to check if it's formatted properly);
 the method returns the proper `assignment2.travel.Destination` value based on the following durations:

    ~~~
    BERLIN      01:34
    ROME        01:45
    AMSTERDAM   02:05
    PARIS       02:20
    HELSINKI    02:43
    ~~~

    - For example, the return value of `getDestination("01:45")` is `Destination.ROME`.
    - If the duration is not listed above, the method returns `null`.
        - Note that it is very bad to return `null`, and you shouldn't do it in real code.

- Its static method `getDestinationDuration()` takes a `Destination` instance and returns the proper duration as string from the table above.

- Its static method `getRoundedHours()` takes a `Destination` instance and returns the number of hours in the duration associated to the argument,
 plus one more if it contains at least `30` minutes.
    - Hint: partition the duration text along the `:` character returned by `getDestinationDuration()`, then convert the two parts to integers.

Create an `assignment2.travel.flying.Flight` class with the following protected fields:
`name` of type String, `destinationCity` of type `Destination`, `numberOfTravellers` of type int, and `flightDateAndTime` of type `DateAndTime`.

- Create getters for all of the fields, the `destinationCity` getter should return the name of the constant, while the `flightDateAndTime` getter should return 
its textual representation.

- `Flight` has two constructors:
    1. A constructor that takes all the fields, and sets their values accordingly.
        - Before doing so, check whether `numberOfTravellers` is at least `15` and at most `100`. If it is outside of this range, throw an 
`IllegalArgumentException`.

    2. A constructor that takes no parameters. It calls the other constructor with the following values: `AirBus`, `ROME`, `83`, and a `DateAndTime` 
instance initialised using the empty constructor

- Create `getFlightDuration()` which returns `String` value, represent the flight duration. (you need to use one of the enum's method here)
- The standard textual representation of `Flight` objects has to look like this: `Flying AirBus with 83 passengers to ROME on 2021.12.22 at 11:42`

# Task 2: Flyable, Plane (3 Points)

Create the interface `assignment2.travel.flying.Flyable` with the method `estimatedArrivalTime` that takes a `Destination` and `departHour`. and the method `getPrice` that 
takes `discountRate` of type `double` and returns a `double` value.

Create the class `assignment2.travel.flying.Plane`, a child class of `Flight` that also implements `Flyable`. It has the following fields: `name` of type 
`String`, `id` of type `int`, and `ticketPrice` of type `int`. All fields have getters, but not setters.

- Its single `private` constructor takes values for its fields and sets their values.
    - It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if `name` is `null` or `ticketPrice` is less than 10.
- Write a static method `make` which takes `data` of type `String` as argument, and returns `Plane` type. `data` is in the form `name,id,ticketPrice`.
    - You do not need to check the format, you may assume that the input data is OK.
    - The method returns a `Plane` object initialized with the three components of `data`.
        - Hint: take `data` apart along the occurrences of the `,` text, then convert the resulting text sections as necessary.
- Two instances of the class are considered equal in content if the values of the three fields are matching, make sure that you override the appropriate method.
    - Also override `hashCode()` based on the values of the three fields.
- Make the textual representation of an instance very simple: `NameOfThePlane,12,83` if the `id` value is `12` and the ticket price is `83`.
- Implement the `estimatedArrivalTime()`. It returns the (integer) hour that is the estimated flight hours later.
    - Example: if the plane departs at `15` hours, and the destination is `01:45` away, the return value is `17`.
    - You may suppose that the departure and arrival happen on the same day.
- The `getPrice()` takes a `discountRate`, a `double`. It returns the `double` price which is the discounted ticket price.
    - Example: if the `ticketPrice` is `100`, and the `discountRate` is `0.2`, the return value is `80`.

# Task 3: FlightWithManyPlanes (3 Points)

Create `assignment2.travel.flying.FlightWithManyPlanes`, a child class of `Flight`. It has a field called `planes`, a list of `Plane`s.

- It has one constructor takes all the fields of the (non-zero-arg) `Flight` constructor, and an arbitrary number of `Plane`s (possibly zero, possibly a thousand of them) in an array.
    - Invoke the constructor of the base class with the arguments.
    - Fill the list with the planes with the elements of the list.
- Create `save()` which takes a `filename`. Open the file and write the following content into it.
    - The first four lines contain the textual representations of `name`, the enum value name of `destination` (hint: enums have a `name()` method), `numberOfTravellers`, and `flightDateAndTime`.
    - The remaining lines each contain the textual representation of a plane.
- Create `load()` which takes a `filename`. Open the file and read the following content from it. You may assume that the file exists, and it contains properly formatted data.
    - Read the first three lines and decode them into the appropriate fields.
    - As decoding a `DateAndTime` would be slightly more complex, you may skip the fourth line. That is, read it and ignore it.
    - Empty `planes`. Then read all remaining lines, and add them as new planes.
- Let both `load()` and `save()` throw `IOException` exception to appease the compiler.
- Create method `getCheapestRide` which takes an argument of type `double`, `discountRateIncrease`.
    - The method throws an `IllegalStateException` if the number of Planes is zero.
    - Otherwise, it finds the plane with the lowest price.
        - The first plane is not discounted at all.
        - With each further plane, the discount rate increases by `discountRateIncrease`.
        - So, the second plane is discounted at `discountRateIncrease`, the third one is at twice `discountRateIncrease` etc.
    - The method returns the reference of the cheapest plane.

# Task 4: Testing (6 Points)
- Testing on Task1: 
   - Both constructors of DateAndTime. Check for the year, month, day, hour, and minute in each test.
   - DestinationUtils. one test case for each method.
 - Testing on Task2: 
   - test cases for equals() and hashCode() methods.
   - two test cases for estimatedArrivalTime() method.
- Testing on Task3:
   - two test cases for load() method.
   - two test cases for save() method.
